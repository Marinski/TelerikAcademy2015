### Pros
* Indexes are sort of a bookmark within a table or a record, to mark a record, such as a primary key.
* Indexes allow the database application to find data fast; without reading the whole table. Somewhat like using a bookmark in a book.
* Index can avoid accessing the table & satisfy the SELECT, which provides result set faster.
* Indexes are used to enforce unique and primary key constraints.
* Indexes help reduce lock contention, e.g. during the child table update where a foreign key exists.

### Cons
* Indexes increase the disk space requirements of the database.
* They slow down dml (inserts, updates and deletes).
* They increase the maintenance needs of your database.
* They may make your queries slower instead of faster.
