**Primary key** is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identify a record in a table, so that an individual record can be located without confusion (for example ID). Primary key is a column of the table that uniquely identifies its rows (usually its is a number). The primary key can be composed by several columns.

The **foreign key** (sometimes called a referencing key) is a key to define the relationship between two tables. It is an identifier of a record located in another table (usually its primary key). Typically you take the primary key field from one table and insert it into the other table where it becomes a foreign key (it remains a primary key in the original table).
