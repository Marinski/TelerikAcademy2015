**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is standardized declarative language for manipulation of information in relational databases.

SQL provides a global standard of working with databases with little or not differences over different platform. For e.g. if you are familiar with SQL you can work with major DBs like SQL Server, mySql & Oracle. Few minor differences in syntax exists but they aren’t very prominent at least as far as basic operations are concerned.
