* A non-relational database is a database that does not incorporate the table/key model that relational database management systems (RDBMS) promote.
* These kinds of databases require data manipulation techniques and processes designed to provide solutions to big data problems that big companies face. 
* The most popular emerging non-relational database is called NoSQL (Not Only SQL).
