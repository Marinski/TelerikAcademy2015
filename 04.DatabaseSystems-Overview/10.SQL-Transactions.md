**Transactions** are a sequence of database operations which are executed as a single unit:
* Either all of them execute successfully
* Or none of them is executed at all

Example:

*A bank transfer from one account into another (withdrawal + deposit). If either the withdrawal or the deposit fails the entire operation should be cancelled.*
