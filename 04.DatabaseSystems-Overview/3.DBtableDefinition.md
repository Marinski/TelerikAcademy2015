A **database table** is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows. A table has a specified number of columns but can have any number of rows.

All rows have the same structure. Columns have name and type (number, string, date, image, or other).

The data in a table does not have to be physically stored in the database. Views also function as relational tables, but their data are calculated at query time. External tables store data outside standard database structures but accessible to database commands.
