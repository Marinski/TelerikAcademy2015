<b>The Foundations of the GPL</b>

Nobody should be restricted by the software they use. There are four freedoms that every user should have:
<ul>
    <li>the freedom to use the software for any purpose,</li>
    <li>the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,</li>
    <li>the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and</li>
    <li>the freedom to share the changes you make.</li>
</ul>
When a program offers users all of these freedoms, we call it free software.

Note: All task conditions can be found at TelerikAcademy <a href="https://github.com/TelerikAcademy/CSharp-Part-1" target="_blank">CSharp-Part-1 Course</a>
